@section('content')
    At Kingland, we have several specialized committees within our Board of Directors. These committees are created to focus on key areas of the business, ensuring that we’re staying on track, making smart decisions, and upholding our values. Each committee has a clear role and responsibility, and they work closely with the Board to guide the company forward.<br><br>

    <span class="font-semibold">What Are Board Committees?</span><br><br>
    Board committees are smaller groups of the Board that handle specific areas of the business, like financial oversight, risk management, or employee matters. These committees help the Board to dive deeper into each area and make sure we're managing things properly. The committees report back to the full Board, so everyone stays informed and aligned.<br><br>

    <span class="font-bold text-2xl">Our Key Committees:</span><br><br>

    Why It Matters: It helps us meet our sustainability goals and fulfill our commitment to corporate social responsibility, ensuring we’re not only profitable but also making a positive difference in the world.<br><br>

    <span class="text-2xl font-bold">Charters for Each Committee</span><br><br>
    Each committee has a clear set of rules or “charters” that define its purpose, responsibilities, and how it should operate. These charters ensure that the committees stay focused on their key tasks and are held accountable for their work.<br><br>

    <span class="font-semibold">What’s in a Charter?</span><br><br>
    A committee’s charter includes:<br>
    The committee’s main responsibilities.<br>
    How often they meet and who should be in the committee.<br>
    The process for reporting back to the full Board.<br>
    Any specific goals or areas they need to focus on.<br><br>

    <span class="font-bold text-darkblue">Why Board Committees Matter</span><br><br>
    
    Having these committees in place helps Kingland operate more effectively and efficiently. Each committee has experts who are dedicated to specific areas, allowing us to make better decisions. The committees provide valuable insights and guidance, helping the full Board make well-informed decisions that support the company’s success and growth.<br><br>

    By having clear committees and well-defined charters, we ensure that Kingland remains a strong, transparent, and responsible company, focused on creating long-term value for everyone involved.
